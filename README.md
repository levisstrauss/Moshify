### Moshify website project
    This is a sample website made as part of learning html and css lessons
    
### Component 
    - During the building process, I first built all components separately and
      then combined them together to form the final website.

### Technologies
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Git
    - GitHub
#### Animation
    AOS (Animate On Scroll) library was used to animate the website.
    - Website: https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/
    - GitHub: https://github.com/michalsnik/aos

     * Usage
        - Add the aos.css file to your project
        - Add the aos.js file to your project after our js file
        - Initialize AOS:  <script>AOS.init();</script>
        
        - Adding animation:
          Let say we want to add animation to a content:
        - The list of all animation is on the github page
       
```html
    <div data-aos="fade-up">
        Content here...
       </div>
```
